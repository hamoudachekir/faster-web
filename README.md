cd faster-web

# Run automated setup (installs dependencies, migrates, seeds database)
composer run setup

# Configure .env file with your database credentials
# For MySQL:
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_DATABASE=faster-web
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=

# For SQLite (simpler):
DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
DB_DATABASE=/absolute/path/to/database.sqlite

# Start development server (runs server, queue worker, logs, and Vite)
composer run dev
```

### Available Scripts

```bash
composer run setup    # Full setup: dependencies, migrations, seeding, assets
composer run dev      # Start all dev servers (Laravel, queue, logs, Vite)
composer run test     # Run PHPUnit tests
```

### Test Credentials

After seeding, you can log in with:
- **Email**: `admin@faster.com`
- **Password**: `password` (generated by UserFactory)

## Deployment

### Option 1: Railway.app (Recommended)

1. **Sign up at [Railway.app](https://railway.app)** with GitHub
2. **Create New Project** → "Deploy from GitHub repo" → Select `hamoudachekir/faster-web`
3. **Add MySQL Database**:
   - Click "New" → "Database" → "MySQL"
   - Railway provides connection details automatically
4. **Add Environment Variables** in Railway dashboard:
   ```env
   APP_NAME="Faster Web"
   APP_ENV=production
   APP_DEBUG=false
   APP_KEY=base64:your-generated-key
   APP_URL=https://your-app.up.railway.app
   
   DB_CONNECTION=mysql
   DB_HOST=${{MYSQL_HOST}}
   DB_PORT=${{MYSQL_PORT}}
   DB_DATABASE=${{MYSQL_DATABASE}}
   DB_USERNAME=${{MYSQL_USER}}
   DB_PASSWORD=${{MYSQL_PASSWORD}}
   
   QUEUE_CONNECTION=database
   SESSION_DRIVER=database
   CACHE_STORE=database
   ```
5. **Deploy**: Railway will automatically detect configuration and deploy

### Option 2: Heroku

```bash
# Install Heroku CLI, then:
heroku create faster-web-app
heroku addons:create cleardb:ignite  # MySQL database
heroku config:set APP_KEY=$(php artisan key:generate --show)
git push heroku main
heroku run php artisan migrate --seed
```

### Option 3: Traditional Hosting (cPanel)

1. Upload files via FTP/SFTP
2. Point domain to `public/` directory
3. Import database and run migrations
4. Configure `.env` with production credentials
